                     <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>Skills for Sale is a startup project based on reviews, where people can
                        list a personal project and find the proper team/person who is offering
                        that service.</p>
                    <p>This project comes as a response to a frequent question “Can you recommand
                        me a person who can do this?”. My solution to find the right person/team
                        to accomplish a listed project in a short time and in a easy way was based
                        on reviews.</p>
                    <p>I built this application from scratch, following IDF’s Centered Design
                        Thinking process and after the prototype (in Sketch) was done I implemented
                        using html 5, css3, css grid.</p>
                     <h3>My design process</h3>

                    <p>I decided to follow IDF’s Centered Design Thinking process to make sure
                        that my design decisions were supported by user research (personas, card
                        sorting) and feedback.</p>
                    <div class="centered">
                        <img src="../images/design-thinking.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                     <h3>Persona</h3>

                    <p>I created two provisional personas based on my understanding of people
                        who I knew that will use an application where you can list a project and
                        find the right person who will offer you that service you are looking for,
                        based on reviews.</p>
                    <div class="centered">
                        <img src="../images/personas.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                     <h3>Job Stories and Customer Journey Map</h3>

                    <p>I used these two UX deliverables to put myself in customer’s shoe in scope
                        to understand their motivations, problems and needs, emotions and to discover
                        all the steps taken by a user to meet a specific goal.</p>
                     <h4>Job stories</h4>

                    <p class="italic">1. When I want to go to the theater with my husband, I want to find a
                        trusted babysitter based on recommandations, so I can spend my time without
                        worry for my baby.</p>
                    <p class="italic">2. When I want to find a new project based on my skills, I want people
                        to see my reviews for my latest projects, so I can obtain that job.</p>
                    <p
                    class="italic">3. When I want to renovate my apartament, I want to find in an easy and
                        quick way a team, so I can move there in time.</p>
                         <h4>Customer Journey Map</h4>

                        <div class="centered">
                            <img src="../images/user-journey-map.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                         <h3>Identifying and prioritising Pain Points</h3>

                        <p>Based on my discoveries ( personas, job stories, user journey map), I
                            could identify and priorities the most important Pain Points:</p>
                        <p class="italic">1. People had difficulty finding a qualified person/team to help them
                            with a personal project, on time and with best results.</p>
                        <p class="italic">2. People that are offering a service want to be listed and recognised
                            for their qualified work in scope to stand out from the rest and to find
                            new projects.</p>
                         <h3>User flow</h3>

                        <p>I choose to follow the pain point 1 because this is a problem that I want
                            to tackle in my design solutions.</p>
                        <p>Using the User Flow diagram helped me to discover the steps that user
                            has to follow to meet his goal, in our case to solve his problem in the
                            shortest and easiest way.</p>
                        <div class="centered">
                            <img src="../images/user-flow.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                         <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>

                        <p>The wireframing step alloweded me to prioritize the content, functionalities
                            available, the information hierarchy of the design. This helped me be focused
                            on user needs and to find the best solutions . I also created the logo,
                            I chose the banding colors and typography and then I went to the high-fidelity
                            prototype in Sketch.</p>
                         <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                        <p>Working at this project was a opportunity for me to learn and apply UX
                            deliverables.</p>
